Issues, TODOs
-----------------------------------

DONE-add game status to detect when draw (all 9 boxes are filled and there is no winner)
FIXED -the AIPlayer will hang (infinite loop) when the game is draw

-consider enhance the Game class to provide more information on the board status

-the board is inverted when print to json in Postman, see whether this is a problem

-i can only run debugging (able to see source code with breakpoint navigation) only when I use jetty plugin to run
 -fails (cannot find source) when using tomcat plugin to run
 -is it because I didn't include the tomcat plugin in the pom.xml?
 
-come up with a better AI Player

-utilize the Test4 heatbeat and scheduler to make something
 -might need to enhance the interfaces a bit in the Test4 component, so as to easily add events and initialize
 -might need to refactor this package (rename from Test4 to something else)
